# EZ KCL
This is an easy GUI interface to assist in building Mario Kart Wii KCL files using Wiimm's KCL 
Tool. As opposed to other tools, you don't have to look up and input the KCL flag yourself. 
Instead, simply click the KCL settings you want to see on a material, and press encode. 

## Dependencies
* Wiimm's KCL Tool

## Running in python
```
python3 ./ezkcl/__main__.py
```
